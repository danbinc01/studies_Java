-When to use String, StringBuilder and StringBuffer
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-vs-stringbuilder-vs-stringbuffer-in-java/
-String is imutable, so when the variable will/need to maintain constant along the code, you should use this class
-When the variable need to change and there is no problem in being thread-safe, use StringBuilder because it'll be enough
-When it does need to change mut multiple threads will use this variable, use StringBuffer because this class is mutable and thead-safe.
So there are situations that we don't  need to make a thread-safe code... what are they?...

-Why make non-thread-safe code?

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/234341/should-i-always-make-my-java-code-thread-safe-or-for-performance-reasons-do-it
For several reasons
	"Requires more skilled developers
	Is harder and nsumes more coding efforts
	Is harder to test and debug
	Usually has bigger performance cost"
Basically if you don't need to make a thread-safe code, it's better no to.
